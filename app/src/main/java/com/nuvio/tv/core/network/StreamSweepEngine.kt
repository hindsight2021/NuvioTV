/**
 * The adaptive greedy stream sweep, extracted behaviour-identical from
 * NetworkSettingsScreen.runStreamDiagnostics so the Advanced-settings card and
 * the Device Assessment share ONE implementation (single source of truth —
 * the same rationale as MemoryBudget.prefetchDepthChunks). Labels, stop
 * rules, memory gating and verdict strings are unchanged; only the Compose
 * state mutations became callbacks and the verdict is additionally returned
 * in structured form.
 *
 * Threading: run() executes on the caller's dispatcher and suspends into IO
 * inside StreamSpeedTester for the transfers, exactly as the inline original
 * did from its scope.launch. Callbacks therefore fire on the caller's context.
 *
 * Algorithm (Item 1(b)) — unchanged:
 *   Stage 1  Baseline (single connection). If it already meets the target
 *            (2x the last title's average bitrate) the verdict is "leave
 *            parallel off" and the sweep ends - parallel connections only
 *            help when one connection cannot feed the title.
 *   Stage 2  Chunk climb at 2 connections up the 8/16/32/64/128 ladder.
 *   Stage 3  Connection climb at the best chunk: 3 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16 (counts
 *            above 4 need Nuvio Performance Mode at runtime; rows are
 *            labelled).
 *   Stage 4  Neighbour refinement around the best config (chunk up, conn
 *            up, chunk down).
 *   Stage 5  Below-target cross-check: if the target is still unmet with
 *            pass budget left, probe untested 3- and 4-connection combos
 *            against the two strongest chunk sizes measured this session,
 *            cheapest first, stopping the moment a pass meets the target.
 * Stop rules are asymmetric around the target. While the target is UNMET,
 * every Mbps matters: climbs continue on any gain and get one grace step
 * through a single regression (single-sample passes are noisy - one dip
 * is not a wall), stopping only when a second consecutive rung fails to
 * recover. Once the target is MET, the economy rule applies: continue or
 * adopt only on >=10% gains. Sustained 429 rate-limiting on debrid CDNs
 * shows up as consecutive collapses and still stops the climb.
 * Every candidate is gated against the device RAM tier first (the
 * safe/warning native limits, matching the tester's native-memory
 * allocations); configs beyond the warning limit never run, rows between
 * safe and warning are marked. Hard cap of 12 parallel passes; once the
 * target is met at most 2 further passes run (to show headroom). The
 * winner is a recommendation, not a provable optimum.
